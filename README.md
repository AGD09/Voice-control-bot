# Voice-control-bot

The project aims to develop a voice-controlled bot utilizing arduino Uno microcontroller and a speech recognition module. The system allows users to interact with the bot through predefined voice commands to initiate movements or actions.


## Hardware Reqirements
- Arduino Uno Microcontroller
- Speech Recognition Module
- Motor Drivers/Motors
- Power Supply



## Implementation

A voice-controlled bot using Arduino Uno involves connecting a microphone for input and a motor or actuators for output. The Arduino Uno processes voice commands through a speech recognition module like EasyVR or an external library. Once recognized, specific commands trigger the connected motors or actuators, enabling the bot to perform desired actions, all within a simple and efficient setup
